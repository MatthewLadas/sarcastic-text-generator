# sarcastic-text-generator

This project aims to practice what I’ve recently learned in JavaScript. I’ll be adding HTML and CSS starter files as the project’s goal is to focus solely on JS.

I’ll be using this Sarcastic-Text-Generator to re-enforce my knowledge on manipulating the DOM, using Functions, Event Listeners, Logic and Flow Control, Loops and Conditionals.
